    # The script calculates the insurance cost for different ages and BMI values and plots the results using the  matplotlib  library. The  np.arange  function is used to create ranges for the factors, and the insurance cost is calculated based on the provided formula. The results are then plotted using two subplots to show the impact of age and BMI on insurance cost. 
    # Running the Script 
    #To run the script, you can use the following command: 
    # python scripts.py 
    # This will execute the script and display the plots showing the estimated insurance cost for different ages and BMI values. 
    # Conclusion 
    # In this tutorial, you learned how to simulate the impact of different factors on insurance costs using Python. You created a simple script that calculates insurance costs based on age and BMI values and plotted the results using the  matplotlib  library. You can further extend this script to include additional factors or more complex calculations to simulate the impact of various factors on insurance costs.
