# Python-Syntax-Medical-Insurance-Project

a Python project involving building a basic medical insurance cost estimator. Here’s how I broke it down and what you can do to complete this project. 

Define Variables

In this project, you’ll likely be calculating insurance cost based on these factors:

age – the person’s age
sex – either 0 for female or 1 for male
bmi – Body Mass Index
children – number of children they have
smoker – 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker

Step 2 was to create a formula,

Step 3 was building a baisc Python Script however I have previous expierence with Python and Data Science so I went for something more advanced. I added a Plot Result.

Here are the plots:

Insurance Cost vs Age: Shows how insurance cost increases with age.
Insurance Cost vs BMI: Highlights the impact of BMI on insurance cost.

Be Sure to have Python installed and Pip Install Matplotlib and pip install numpy!!

  Thank you :)
